License for VDHL source code of "Resurrector"
#############################################

License agreements usually are long and hard to read.
Let's keep this one small and simple (a good rule for designing
hardware and code, btw).

The licensor Michael Boehmer permits the usage of this product under the 
following license conditions:

(1) No warranties, see below. This code has been translated from legacy HDLs, 
    and just been simulated. It never has been implemented in real hardware,
    while I tried to simulate it as good as possible.

(2) Use it for free, even for commercial products, as long as your code is 
    open source, too. You need to mention the source of this design
    in your release, publish it under the same conditions as this project 
    and include this license text.
    No closed source may origin from this project.

(3) If you find bugs, fix them or make other improvements, let me know
    and include them in your open source publication.

(4) In case you are from Elbox, or affiliated with them, be my guest. 
    Just one extra rule in that case: the SharkPPC must be on sale first, 
    if you want to use this project.

Still with me? 

In case you find this project useful, and want to appreciate it, my daughter was
born in 2012. So guess her age, and send her a present :)
NO unicorns. Absolutely. Even if they are pink and have glitter.
